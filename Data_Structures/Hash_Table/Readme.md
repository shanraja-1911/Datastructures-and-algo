# Hash Table 
They are usually pretty good !. They have a great time complexity O(1) in most of the cases (insert, delete, lookup, search), the only disadvantage is the collison. 

Once there is a memory collison, it tends to form a linked list. 

# Difference between a map and key

map can have any datatype as key , while the hash table can have only string or number.
