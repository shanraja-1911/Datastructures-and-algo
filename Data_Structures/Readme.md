# Big O

 A Good code has these 3 components <br>

  * ** Readable**
  * ** Memory efficient**
  * ** Time efficient **

The Same notion of Big O is used to address both the time and the space complexity.  

- What causes space complexity?
  
  * variables 
  * Data structures 
  * Function Call
  * Allocations


A good map of the data structures can be found in the following link :
